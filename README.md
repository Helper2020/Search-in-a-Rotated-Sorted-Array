# Search-in-a-Rotated-Sorted-Array

I first find the pivot using a modified binary search.
Each side of the pivot a binary search is done.
The requirements for the problem is O(log(n)) since binary search
cuts the problem in half everytime and it fits the project requirements.

Where n the number of elements in the array
Time complexity is O(log(n))

Where n is the size of the array
Space complexity is O(n)
